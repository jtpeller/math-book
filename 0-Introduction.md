## Introduction

This prologue will introduce basic mathematical terms, operations, notations, properties, constants, and more.

## Terminology

There's a lot of terminology that floats around mathematics. This section aims to define the basic terminology that will be used nearly everywhere.

- Expression: Mathematical statement where no solution is stated. Think of it like a phrase, rather than a complete sentence.
  - Example: $2 + 2$
- Equation: A mathematical "sentence" that contains an equal sign (or similar operator) to denote equality (or other relationship). Think of it like a complete sentence.
  - Example: $x = 2 + 2$
  - Here, $x$ can be "solved for" by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side. So, you could equivalently say, $x = 4$
- Formula: A mathematical model to define a relationship.
- Function: A formula with inputs and outputs. The output is computed from the inputs based upon the defined relationship.
  - Example: $f(x) = 2x + 4$
  - This is equivalent to saying "The function $f$, takes the input $x$, multiplies it by $2$ and adds $4$ to compute the output."
  - Functions have unique terms that are used, like "plugging in" a value (plug-and-chug!), solving for a variable, etc.
  - Equation and function are often used interchangeably.

Features of these statements can be defined with these terms:

- Operand: Number or term that is undergoing the action from an *operator* to produce a solution.
  - AKA: term.
- Operator: A symbol used to denote a specific action to be done to the operands.
  - Examples: addition (Symbol: $+$), subtraction (Symbol: $-$), etc.
- Operation: Describes the overall actions being done to operands.
  - Examples: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
