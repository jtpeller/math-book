## Introduction

This book offers a very wholistic view of mathematics. The aim is to present mathematics in such a way to allow building from this prologue -- the very basics -- to complex mathematical operations and formula.

Originally, this book just contained a bunch of definitions, some basic notes, and maybe a few examples to *summarize* courses I've taken in school. Instead, this is now meant to act as a useful resource for all things math. It aims to contain examples, more useful diagrams, tables, and figures to help solidify concepts.

This prologue unit is aimed to lay the groundwork. It will introduce basic mathematical terms, operations, notations, properties, constants, and more. These are things fundamental to math, and likely concepts you have already come across.

There are also concepts in this section that exist well beyond what you need to know right now. This section is meant to act as a reference throughout the book; a central resource for the fundamentals. There will be symbols, values, terms, or operations that are not yet meaningful. They will be covered more fully in the later units!
