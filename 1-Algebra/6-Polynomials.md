## Overview

While linear functions represent a broad range of functions, the rest of functions can be considered non-linear (obviously).

One important type of non-linear function are polynomial functions. As a simple exercise, imagine what would happen to a function like $y = 2x + 5$ if $x$ was raised to the power of 2, 3, or any other number.

Such a function is a _polynomial_. This class of functions encompass a whole range of functions with unique characteristics, which will be explored in this section.

## Introduction to Polynomials

As stated in previous chapters, polynomials are simply a series of terms added (or subtracted) together. Polynomials are always of the form:

$$
f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-2}+...+a_1x+a_0
$$

Here, $a$ simply represents a constant (e.g., $a_n$ may be 4, while $a_{n-1}$ may be 15). $n$ is some non-negative integer that represents the _degree_ of the polynomial. That is, the **_degree_** of a polynomial is the largest power of the polynomial.

For example, $x^3+2x^2+5x+4$ has a degree of 3, since $x^3$ has the largest power.
