# math-book

A math book I wrote that covers math from basic operations all the way to differential equations. Based upon my school notes and many things I picked up along the way.

## Origins

This book was originally began in October of 2019, completed sometime during the COVID-19 pandemic, left to collect digital dust for a few years (to age like fine wine), and finally revived in 2025 when I decided to finally get around to making the document a lot better.

This document began as a Word doc that became around 210 pages. Maintaining this was cumbersome as even loading the document took a couple minutes, not to mention the lag and slow-loading images.

Therefore, Markdown has been selected for the revival, so it can be version controlled, cleaned up, and separated nicely. It also has the added benefit of being relatively easily converted to other formats, like HTML, Word docs, etc.

## Units

There are 6 units (seven, technically) in this math textbook. Each are split into their own Markdown file.

0. Prologue: Operations, Notations, and Properties
1. Unit I: Numerical Models
2. Unit II: Trigonometry
3. Unit III: Geometry
4. Unit IV: Algebraic Models
5. Unit V: Calculus
6. Unit VI: Differential Equations

## Conventions

This follows a few conventions.

1. Filenames are of the format: `[Unit number]-Title.md`. Title will be `UpperCamelCase`. The number ensures proper ordering in file explorers.
   1. For example: `0-OperationsNotationsProperties.md`
2. Pictures will all go in the `img` folder, separated by unit.
3. Units aim to go over the same topic.
4. Markdown best practices will be balanced with design. The book should look good, but so should the code.
5. Title of the unit's markdown will be the unit title (e.g., `# Prologue: Operations, Notations, and Properties`)
6. Subheaders act as subheaders to create a nice tree.
7. Definitions will be underlined.
8. Mathematical notations will be done using inline and code blocks as needed.
9. Hyperlinks will exist throughout the book as necessary. Links will be to the closest section possible.

## Download, Usage, Whatnot

## Other books

Although not on GitHub (yet), I have many other books, including Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy, and plenty of others that will find their way here. Math is just the first one I am beginning with.
